#+TITLE: Dumang DK6 Keyboard

Setup two Dumang DK6 keyboards to work on MacOS.

Product link: [[dumang][Dumang DK6]] (Official website in Chinese)

As of 20201110, the [[dumang-app][Dumang app]] only has a Windows version. You'll need a Windows system, either in a real machine or a virtual machine, to configure the keyboard. And on Windows, you will have no issue using two Dumang DK6 keyboards. Everything works perfectly out of box on Windows. But if you are on MacOS, three problems must be solved before you could make full use of two DK6 keyboards.

* Issues and Solutions on Mac
** [Issue-1] Common key combos not working
*** Issue
Common key combos don't work if the keys of the combo are not on the same keyboard. For example, with dvorak layout, the following key combos will not work: =Left-Cmd= + =c=, =Left-Ctrl= + =d=, or =Left-Option= + =r=, because =c= =d= =r= are all on the right.

*** Solution
Install [[https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org][Karabiner-elements]] (here is the [[karabiner-installation][installation instruction]]). Once the installation and setup is done, open the app and the issue will be gone. No further configuration is required. Add the app to login item list so that you don't need to open it every time you login the system.

** [Issue-2] Layer switching key combos not working
*** Issue
This issue is similar to Issue-1, but instead happens to the layer switching key (aka the =Fn= key). =Fn= key combos don't work if the keys of the combo are not on the same keyboard. For example, with =Fn= configured to switching to layer 1 and with dvorak layout, =Fn= + =c= will not do what you have configured it to do. When you press a =Fn= key combo, the layer indicating LED is red on the =Fn= side and cyan on the =c= side which should've been red, too. (layer to LED color mapping: 0(default layer): cyan, 1: red, 2: green, 3: blue)

*** Solution
Install and setup [[https://pypi.org/project/dumang-ctrl/][Dumang-ctrl]]. Dumang-ctrl is a runnable script written in Python 3. It syncs the events between two Dumang DK6 keyboards. For example, when you press =Fn= on one board to switch to layer 1, the other board will also be switched to layer 1.
1. Install [[https://brew.sh][Homebrew]]
2. Setup Python3
   1. Install Python3
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       brew install python # this installs python3 by default
       #+END_SRC
   2. Add python lib to =$PATH=
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       # Setting PATH for homebrew Python
       export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
       #+END_SRC
3. Install =dumang-ctrl= and its dependencies
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       brew install libusb
       pip install dumang-ctrl libusb1 libusb
       #+END_SRC
4. Run =dumang-sync= in terminal
5. Press =Fn= on one keyboard, and the light on other board should now be red (layer 1).

** [Issue-3] =dumang-sync= failed to resync on system wake up and keyboard reconnecting
*** Issue
When you do a fresh run of =dumang-sync=, everything works fine immediately. However, whenever MacOS wakes up from sleep, or you logout and login, or if you plug out and plug in the keyboards, it failed to resync. Checking the log, the script seemed to be trying to auto detect the hot plugging, yet it just failed to resync.

*** Solution
Killing and restarting the daemon will solve the problem. Since sleeping and waking up from sleep happens very often, there must be a way to quickly bring the daemon back to life. But to do it manually and frequently in terminal is counter-efficient, and keeping a terminal window open all the time running the daemon is cluttered. The best way is to just press one key or key combo and the daemon would get restarted. I came up with a solution by integrating Shell script, Automator, and QuickSilver.
1. Create an Automator application to run the following shell scipt to do auto killing and restarting. Save the application as =Dumang-Sync=.
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      pgrep -f dumang-sync | xargs kill
      /usr/local/bin/dumang-sync > /dev/null 2>&1 &
     #+END_SRC
2. Install [[https://qsapp.com][QuickSilver]]. Add a trigger to open the app created above, and assign a shortcut to the trigger, for example, =Cmd= + =Home=. The key combo must not be a =Fn= combo as the daemon had already stopped working at the time. Now, you can just press =Cmd= + =Home= to bring the daemon back to life.
3. Auto launch =dumang-sync= on system startup. Add the =dumang-sync= app to login item list so that you don't need to open it every time you login the system, though it's just one key combo away.
